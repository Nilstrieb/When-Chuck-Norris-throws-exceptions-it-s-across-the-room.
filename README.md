A minimal application to play with JPA and spring data topics.

## üê≥ Postgres with Docker

A simple solution expects a https://www.baeldung.com/linux/docker-run-without-sudo[running docker without sudo].
To get a Database connection (and associated JPA-autocomplete), run `./gradlew bootRun` (it will hang).

Alternatively launch a postgres docker container similar to the `dockerPostgres`-Task in `build.gradle` by hand.

Use the default Java Spring naming conventions. Services `*Service`, repositories `*Repository`, controllers `*Controller`.

Formatting uses the default IntelliJ config, whatever that is.

Every pull request should follow the pull request template and, in spirit with the project, include one joke at the end.
